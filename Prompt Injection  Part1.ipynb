      "Q: Mozart's father, Leopold Mozart, was a renowned composer and conductor. Can you elaborate on their collaborative works and the impact it had on Wolfgang's musical development? \n",
      "A: Leopold Mozart was actually more known as a violinist, composer, and music teacher rather than a composer. He did compose some works, but his main focus was on teaching and promoting his son's musical talents. Leopold's guidance and teachings greatly influenced Wolfgang's musical development, helping him become the prodigious composer he was. \n",
